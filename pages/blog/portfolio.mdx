# Portfolio

## Contents

This portfolio will contain

*   this file, with references,
*   a link to [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksander-sobieraj/),
*   [things I would like people to read](/blog).

This is an unfinished project meant to explore and showcase web development skills.

## Stack

Tools I used to make this portfolio

*   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling and as a dev server
*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for input-output compatibility
*   [React](https://reactjs.org/) for UI data binding
*   [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog pages like this one
*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for routing and pre-rendering
*   [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) and [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for authentication
*   [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for hosting
*   [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for data storage
*   [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) for interacting with the database
*   [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for DNS
*   [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) for CloudFormation templates

This portfolio does not include

*   a CSS library, because this portfolio is sparsely styled,
*   custom deployment scripts, because serverless has good enough defaults,
*   spelling mistakes ðŸ˜‰ or authentication tokens ðŸ¤ž.

## Roadmap

My to-do list for this portfolio

*   optimized images
*   a Three.js button
*   a D3 graph

*   [a request queue](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-background-sync) for API calls
*   request limts
*   lazy loading
*   pre-fetched, small bundles
*   a sitemap
*   accessible HTML
*   pastel colours
*   several modern CSS features
*   a Dockerfile
